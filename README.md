**Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT)**

This script computes integrated water vapor transport by integrating specific humidity (q) and horizontal wind components (u, v) over a specified vertical pressure range. The output can be used to study moisture flux patterns and their role in large-scale weather systems.
